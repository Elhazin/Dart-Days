# My Dart Learning Journey

## The First Day with Dart
Dart is a programming language developed by Google, primarily used for mobile app and web app development. 

First, I felt inspired to start my journey in mobile app development. After researching various languages, I discovered Flutter, a powerful tool for building mobile apps. I heard that it is beginner-friendly and efficient, so I made the decision to dive into Flutter. However, I realized that to master Flutter, I needed to grasp the basics of Dart, as Flutter is based on Dart. Consequently, I focused on learning the fundamentals of Dart, such as syntax for conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and objects.

This repository serves as a journal of my daily learnings in Dart, serving as a log of my progress and the new concepts I absorb each day. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled web and mobile developer.

## SECOND DAY WITH DART
On this day, I delved into learning about conditions, function calls, creating classes, and generating objects from those classes. I decided to practice my skills by solving the "Roman to Integer" problem on LeetCode. This exercise proved to be an excellent starting point, allowing me to understand the nuances between dynamic and static variables in Dart. I also discovered that Dart supports arrow functions, similar to JavaScript.
